## Personalized Feed Algorithm Project


## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a personalized feed algorithm that predicts relevant posts for users based on their interactions with content. The algorithm leverages machine learning techniques to rank posts according to their relevance and recency scores.


## Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.


## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:



git clone https://github.com/Moushreeta/AITASK1.git

Navigate into the project directory:

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment (skip this step if not using a virtual environment):

On Windows:


venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS and Linux:


source venv/bin/activate

Install the required Python libraries:


pip install -r Requirements1.txt

Running the Code
Ensure you are in the project directory with the virtual environment activated.

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the algorithm implementation:

python AI_Task.py

Follow the prompts or instructions within the script or notebook to interact with the algorithm and generate personalized feeds.

## Project Structure


data: Contains sample CSV file with synthetic user interaction data.

AI_Task.py: Python script implementing the personalized feed algorithm.

Requirements1.txt: File listing Python libraries required for the project.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Usage

Modify AI_Task.py to integrate with your own dataset or modify algorithm parameters.

Customize feature engineering or machine learning models as per your specific requirements.
